/*Normal use of these functions would be:
   1) Decide how large of a string you will extract, 1K? 2K? 100K?
   2) For each chromosome file, 1 to 22, X and Y....
      a) Open a chromosome file with OpenChromosomeFile function.
      b) Call FetchData to return a string of the size you chose above
      c) Search that string to see if it contains the ALU gene.
         i) NOTE: If the string you are extracting is large enough it may appear multiple times
            within the same string.
         ii) If found add this data to your statistics.
         iii) Call CleanUpFetchedDNa() with the string so that it can be released into memory.
      d) Repeat until the number of DNA characters actually read does not match the requested
             amount. This means the file has ended (or an error has occurred).
      e) Output the statistics for that chromosome
